# Movie Recommendation

This is movie recommendation model that i built using streamlit. Here i am using tmdb_5000 movie dataset.



## Installation

Install every package listed in requirements.txt, then enter the following code to start the application.

One item that is really significant is that there should be a file called "similairity.pkl," but I am unable to upload it because it is over 100 MB in size. You may access this file by running a Jupyter notebook, though.

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt  
  streamlit run main.py
```
